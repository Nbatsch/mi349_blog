            <h3>First Impressions of Disney's Andor</h3>

                As someone who is a very big fan of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise, I was very excited
                about the announcement of <em>Andor</em>, a story that would be following a popular rebel
                hero from <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em>. The show premiered on Wednesday, September
                28th with three episodes, which was a nice chunk of content for us fans to sink our
                teeth into. These first few episodes were solid and provided a good foundation for
                the rest of the show. Immediately you could tell that they wanted to emphasize the
                darker tone that the show would take compared to most other <em>Star Wars</em> content. Sure
                <em>The Mandalorian</em> is about an intergalactic bounty hunter, but he also has a wholesome
                child to take care of and attempts to act with some degree of morality. <em>Andor</em>
                imediately dispels the idea of this show being another tame Star Wars series when
                Cassian murders two imperials and becomes a runaway fugitive.
                After watching the first three episodes, I was convinced the show would be worth
                watching, but it didn't seem like a show that would captivate me the way <em>The
                    Mandalorian</em> did. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong; every new
                episode that's been released since has been fantastic, and with a runtime of 45
                minutes or more. The theme of this show being a bit darker than typical <em>Star Wars</em>
                media, along with the fact that we get more content in each episode has left me
                very satisfied thus far, and I'm definitely looking forward to watching a new
                episode every Wednesday.

            <h3>Is the New Modern Warfare 2 a Worthy Successor to the 2009 Classic?</h3>

            <p>Published: 10/16/2022</p>
            <p>
                With the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 almost here, lets talk a
                little bit about my first impressions with the gameplay that has been
                released, as well as my own experiences with the beta for this
                brand new title taking on the name of what many consider the best Call of Duty
                in the entire franchise. To start off, Modern Warfare 2 was undoubtedly my
                favorite installment of the COD franchise; throwing a new coat of paint on
                the old maps and weapons while updating some of the gunplay mechanics would
                have been a perfectly viable option for this new title, but they went ahead
                and made a very <em>new</em> feeling game. The gunplay is definitely more
                unforgiving than in previous Call of Duty games, but the progression system
                for weapons quickly alleviates this problem and adds some new elements to the
                create-a-class system that weren't present before. </p>
            <p>For starters, weapons are now based around a main receiver type which affects
                weapon class (e.g., assault rifle, marksman rifle, submachine gun, etc.).
                You level up weapons by getting kills with them and completing challenges,
                which is similar to other COD games, but now there is also a progression tree
                for each gun. For example, after hitting level 12 with the starting M4, you'll
                unlock the FTAC Recon, which is a receiver for a semi-auto battle rifle. At
                level 16 you'll gain access to a new receiver, the FSS Hurricane. Each of these
                receivers has different attachments to unlock, but when requirements are met,
                they are also retroactively unlocked for the previous receivers in the progression
                tree.

            </p>
            <p>
                So far we haven't seen any of the
                original maps outside of the new Warzone 2 gamemode, but there is
                still a high likelihood that we could get remasters of maps like <em>Terminal,
                    High Rise, Rust, and Favela</em> which fans would love to see. Overall, I think
                Modern Warfare 2 2022 is shaping up to be worthy of representing the MW2 name.
